            <p>Currently, I'm on an exciting journey to level up my skills as a front-end developer at Medieinstitutet. 
              I'm not stopping there though â€“ I'm also diving headfirst into graphic design and UX courses to 
              finesse my design chops and learn how to craft seriously kick-ass user interfaces. 
              Because I genuinely believe that a killer website can make a world of difference.</p>

            <p>But my digital adventures are just one part of the story. 
              You see, I also have a gig in the yoga and health space. And here's the fun part: 
              I'm thrilled to merge my passion for creativity with web development and design, helping businesses 
              rock their online presence. I'm all about dreaming up cool ideas and turning them into a digital reality.</p>

            <p>When I'm not glued to my computer, you'll find me seeking tranquility 
              in a yoga studio, scaling climbing walls, or or out on the open waters, sailing and basking in the beauty of the ocean.</p>

            <p className='italic'>So, if you're in search of a website that's not just pixels and code but a true reflection of your essence and a magnet for your audience, 
            <Link to='/contact' className='thin'>let's team up and turn that vision into a digital masterpiece.</Link> I'm excited about the possibility of creating something amazing together.</p>
